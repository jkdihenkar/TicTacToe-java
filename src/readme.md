#TicTacToe in Java

##Steps to compile : 

1. first compile the 'panel.java' : javac panel.java
2. compile the 'game.java' : javac game.java
3. run the game.class as : 'java game'

NOTE : if there is an error in above steps then....

-> class path is not set... Set it under *NIX os family as : 

export CLASSPATH="."

-> under windows , set class path as : 

open MyComputer Properties -> Advanced Tab -> Environmental Variable
there : 
1. set PATH = ".:c:/<path to jdk>"
2. set CLASSPATH = ".:c:/<path to jdk>"
3. set CLASS = ".:c:/<path to jdk>"

---> Do give feedback on Code : jd
